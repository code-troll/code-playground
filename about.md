I'm a self-thought and curiosity-driven developer I'm 30 years old and I started to get immersed in this amazing world of software development when I was 16 years old.

My passions are high-level programming languages such as NodeJS, PHP, and Python.

I'm currently living in Copenhagen, Denmark and working as a developer.
